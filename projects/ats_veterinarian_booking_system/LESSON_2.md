# Coding the ATS Veterinarian Booking System using AI

Ask AI to create a base Web2py application based on your design. You should model this as close as possible to the design. For example, the following requests specify the relationship between each entity (table) and specify the attributes (fields), in two requests.

- *[Introducion](README.md)
- *[Lesson 1. Define the base Web2py application](LESSON_1.md)
- *[Lesson 2. Create the create_pet view](LESSON_2.md)
- *[Lesson 3. Implement Form Validation and Datatypes](LESSON_3.md)
- *[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**IMPORTANT:**

When using AI it is best practive to keep each request in the same conversation.

# Lesson 2. Create the create_pet view #

AI did not generate the code for the create_pet.html,

You can simply ask it to do so.

Certainly! Here's an example of the create_pet.html view file for creating a new pet in the ATS Veterinary Booking System:

```html
{{extend 'layout.html'}}

<h1>Add Pet</h1>

<form method="post" action="{{=URL('create_pet')}}">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><label for="name">Name:</label></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="name" id="name" required></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><label for="breed">Breed:</label></td>
            <td><input type="text" name="breed" id="breed" required></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><label for="sex">Sex:</label></td>
            <td>
                <select name="sex" id="sex" required>
                    <option value="M">Male</option>
                    <option value="F">Female</option>
                </select>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
                <input type="submit" value="Add Pet" class="btn">
                <a href="{{=URL('index')}}" class="btn">Cancel</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</form>
```

In this form, the user can enter the pet's name, breed, and select the sex from a dropdown menu. The form is submitted to the create_pet URL, which will handle the creation of the pet in the controller.

Make sure to save this file as create_pet.html in your views/default directory.

## Implement the code ##

**Create a view pets/create_pet.html**

NOTE: For the purpose of this tutorial we will use {{=form}} which will render it own html.

```html
{{extend 'layout.html'}}

<h1>Add Pet</h1>
{{=form}}
```

**From the Pet Index page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/ats_bookings/pets/index), click Add Pet**

1. Enter the name, breed and select sex.
2. Click Add Pet

![Create Pet Page and Form](img/ats_booking__lesson_2__pets_create_pet_page.png)

3. The implementation has limited or innaccurate functionality. 

4. After the form has submitted, you should see the record appear on the Pets index page (alternatively, select Pets > List from the main menu).
