# Coding the ATS Veterinarian Booking System using AI

Ask AI to create a base Web2py application based on your design. You should model this as close as possible to the design. For example, the following requests specify the relationship between each entity (table) and specify the attributes (fields), in two requests.

- *[Introducion](README.md)
- *[Lesson 1. Define the base Web2py application](LESSON_1.md)
- *[Lesson 2. Create the create_pet view](LESSON_2.md)
- *[Lesson 3. Implement Form Validation and Datatypes](LESSON_3.md)
- *[Lesson 4. Create controllers for CRUD actions for each entity](LESSON_4.md)
- *[Lesson 5. Fixing and creating relationships](LESSON_5.md)
- *[Lesson 6. Functional Testing and Boundary Testing](LESSON_6.md)
- *[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**IMPORTANT:**

When using AI it is best practive to keep each request in the same conversation.
